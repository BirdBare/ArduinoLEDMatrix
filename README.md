ANYONE CAN USE THIS FOR ANYTHING
================

This Repo will be a collection of classes and functions used to drive a Matrix of LEDs.
The Matrix was designed and coded around the sn74hc595n so I cannot promise anything
when working with a different Shift Register.

Each sub-directory has a Readme that explains how to use the class. Inside of the .h's are
descriptions of how things work. Function descriptions will always be before the function.
Any other descriptions will be touching the area/object they describe and will always be 
after the described area.
